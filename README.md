# Agroecology-viability
This analysis of a survey data that was collected on agroecology in Kenya by ICRAF.
This survey focuses on the structure and activities of the farming household and farming practices. It will especially highlight cropping and livestock systems and the associated farming practices (non agroecolgoical and agroecological practices specific of each case study area and possibly not being related to the AE project). 

This survey aims at:
-	Understand the relations between practices that implement agroecological principles, other crop and livestock practices and structural characteristics of farms
-	Characterize, the diversity of farms in the study area
